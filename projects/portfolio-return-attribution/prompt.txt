1. Application Overview

Develop a Streamlit-based application that serves as an interactive machine learning portfolio return attribution demo/sandbox. Users will visualize attribution data through dynamic graphs and have the ability to modify input values to see how changes impact these graphs.

2. Functional Requirements

### Graphical Representations:

Display three main types of graphs:
- Attribution Bar Chart
- Contribution Bar Chart
- Cumulative Line Chart

### Dynamic Interactivity:

Implement input sliders or input fields for users to adjust the values of key variables affecting the graphs.
Automatically update graphs based on changes in the input values.

### Attribution Bar Chart:
Display multiple factors such as "ST Revisions," "Flow," "Sector," etc., with categories like "Portfolio," "Linear," "Interactions," and "Nonlinear."
Reflect positive and negative contributions as depicted in the provided example.

### Contribution Bar Chart:
Show percentage contributions of the categories "Portfolio," "Linear," "Interactions," and "Nonlinear."
Ensure graph updates reflect user inputs.

### Cumulative Line Chart:
Plot time-series data showing the growth of "Portfolio," "Linear," "Interactions," and "Nonlinear" over time.
Allow users to visualize changes across dates and investment periods.

### Data Input and Modification:
Enable easy input and modification of data for each category.
Implement data validation to ensure robustness.
